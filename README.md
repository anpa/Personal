# Personal Website & Portefolio

---

I created this project in order to show a little bit of myself and my work as a software/web developer. I wanted it to be simple and appealing, so it can act as a personal website, portefolio and business card. During its development I made some decisions that I recorded here.

* **Responsiveness:** the rise of mobile technology says it all. I wanted this website to be responsive so I defined 2 breakpoints (40rem and 64rem) and introduced some media-queries in CSS, following a mobile-first principle.

* **Frameworks:** although I can see some advantages in using frameworks like Bootstrap and Foundation, I decided not to use them here for two reasons. One was for the sake of simpleness and clutter-free code (even tunning frameworks seemed too complex for a project as simple as this one). The other was to learn by doing (and I've learned a lot) rather than by using code shortcuts. I feel like frameworks solve a lot of problems, but not always we (developers) are aware of them and it's easy to lose the track. So I decided to create my own CSS grid as well as some personalized CSS classes to create a visual structure. There were some headaches in the way but it was totally worth it.

* **SASS:** yes, I'm using SASS! It's a trendy thing but, more important, I find that it helps a lot when it comes to CSS productivity.
