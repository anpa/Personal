Personal Website & Portefolio
========

The main purpose of this project is to show a little bit of myself and my work as a software developer.
It was built using great tools like Sublime Text 2 and Prepos.
It also uses great libraries: jQuery, Modernizr.js and Normalize.js.
Fonts are served by the awesomeness of Google Fonts. I am using Montserrat and Neutron.
